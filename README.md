The goal of this project is to use generative neural network technology to learn hard quantum distributions.
The research framework and results are described in reference [1]. It consists of two main parts: generate hard quantum distributions; train generative neural networks to learn these hard distributions.

For first part of data generation, two types of quantum distributions are studied: 
	A) Distributions generated by quantum Fourier sampling by Fefferman and Umans [2].
	B) Distributions generated by qsim quantum ciruits [3].

The script to generate distribution A) is Fefferman_quantum_distr.py, which follows the mathematical formula described in reference [1] and [2]. Set N to the number of qubits to be sampled. In [1], 3 and 8 qubit results are presented. The quantum sampling outputs are saved in "Quantum_Distr_Fefferman_{}bit.json" for further machine learning studies.

The script to generate distribution B) is QSIM_Beyond_Classical.py, which is borrowed from https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/qsim_beyond_classical/ and revised to use SISWAP() quantum gate. In order to generate distributions with different numbers of qubits, you can simply change the size of array "qubits" at the beginning of the script. The quantum sampling outputs are saved in "QSIM_Binary_Data_{}bit_CZ.json" for further machine learning studies.


For the second part of training generative neural networks, we built two types of NNs: variational autoencdoer (VAE) and normalzing flow (NF).
